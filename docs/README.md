## Introduction

This directory contains further documentation, most of it internal.

## Updating the documentation

Install the python program grip system wide with:

```bash
pip install grip
```

To update any README's, just open the .md file in your favorite text editor. You can render markdown files in your local browser to ensure they look the way you want by running:

```bash
$ grip <filename>
```

This returns a link to a localhost address where you can view the rendered markdown file.
