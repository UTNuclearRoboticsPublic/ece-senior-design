# Docker

## Introduction

Docker is a tool used to test and deploy applications in containers. Containers can be thought of as lightweight virtual machines, although the reality is slightly more complicated. Docker provides a good explanation of containers on their [website](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container).

## Getting Started

The best way to get started is via Docker's website. Docker provides a good 6-step introduction called [Getting Started With Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). It is highly recommended to jump in and get your feet wet. It should take between 30 and 90 minutes to complete.

After completing the tutorial, this [blog post](https://vsupalov.com/6-docker-basics/) should give a nice recap.

## Installation

Docker provides installation instructions on their website for many platforms [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/). For reference, here are a few popular ones:

* [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
* [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
