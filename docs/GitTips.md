## Submitting a Pull Request

In the ideal case, any changes we make are in a branch separate from master. After verifying your changes on your branch, you can navigate to the repository in your web browser and issue a pull request.
This should trigger a Travis build. If the Travis build fails, you can log in to your Travis account and check the build log. Fix any errors in your local repository and commit them to your branch. Each commit will update the pull request and trigger another build.
