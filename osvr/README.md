# Installation

This directory contains a setup script that will setup and install OSVR software, the rviz plugins made by UT Nuclear Robotics Group, and the ROS package `usb_cam`. These files are all set up under your home directory inside a folder named `catkin-ws`.

Your final directory structure will look like this:

```bash
+-- catkin-ws/
    +-- build/
    +-- devel/
    +-- src/
```
